## CU Boulder’s Grand Challenge
##### Our world is facing significant issues with a changing environment,
increasing populations and limited resources. The intersection of people,
resources and   our planet is where CU-Boulder can use its expertise in
space-based observation   and exploration to address our world’s most pressing
problems.

From Jawbone, Earthquake in Napa in 2014:
The recent earthquake in South Napa took many by surprise during the night, but
 to see just how many people woke up to the sound and physical disturbance,
  fitness tracking company Jawbone has released some anonymous data. The chart
   shared shows UP wearers in the Bay Area who track their sleep patterns.
break
A serious portion of UP wearers in Napa, Sonoma, Vallejo and Fairfield are
located near the epicenter and were woken up, but it's interesting to see just
 how the impact gradually weakened as data from users who reside slightly
  further away is included. If you thought your UP was just for monitoring
  fitness, how about a secondary feature for earthquakes?

From Darwin to today. It took Darwin an entire lifetime to collect the data he
needed to fully form the concept of evolution. We have the opportunity today
to create many Darwins in a very short period of time. To accelerate discovery
with rapid testing of new ideas and theory. But it’s no longer a game of an
individual with leather patches sitting alone in his office in the ivory
Tower, it’s also about decentralizing the scientific process and building
strong collaboration networks.

## <a href="http://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/274" target="_blank">Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly</a>
_Florian Markowetz_

1. Reproducibility avoid critical mistakes.
2. Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers.
3. Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way.
4. Reproducibility enables continuity of your work.
5. Reproducibility helps to build your reputation.

## How to Make Work Reproducible


> For research to be reproducible, the research products (data, code) need to be
publicly available in a form that people can find and understand them.

---

## Who do we need to share with?


* Collaborators
* Peer reviewers & journal editors
* Broad scientific community
* The public

## Tools That Support Reproducibility

**GitHub:**
* Version Control
* Collaboration
* Dissemination

---

## Tools That Support Reproducibility

**R Markdown / Jupyter Notebooks:**
* Code Documentation
* Dissemination

---

## Four Facets of Reproducibility

1. Organization
1. Documentation
1. Automation
1. Dissemination

---

## 1. Organization - Files & Directories

The more self explanatory the better:

* Consider overall structure of folders and files.
* Use informative file names.

## 1. Organization - Files

File Organization should:

* Reflect inputs, outputs and information flow.
* Preserve raw data so it's not modified.
* Carefully document & store intermediate & end outputs.
* Carefully document & store data processing scripts.

---

## 1. Organization - Files

![File Organization Graphic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/slide-shows/intro-rr/file-organization.png)

---
## 1. Organization -- File Names

File / Folder Names should be:

* Machine readable.
* Human readable.
* Support sorting.

---

### Which Filenames Are Most Self-explanatory?

![human readible file names]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/slide-shows/intro-rr/human-readable-jenny.png)

## More on File Naming
<a href="https://lwasser.github.io/class-activities/slide-shows/2-file-naming-jenny-bryan/" target="_blank">More on file naming & organization</a>

-- from the Reproducible Science Curriculum.

---

## 1. Organization - Code Variables

* Use self explanatory variable names.
* Comment code so your future self can understand it.
---

## 1. Organization - Code Variables

**More Readable**
```r
# import canopy N values for
# decid & coniferous forest sampling
conifer.N <- read.csv("conifer-sampling.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")

decid.N <- read.csv("decid-sampling.csv",
                    header=TRUE,
                    sep=",")

# Calc total forest N
total.N <- conifer.N + decid.N

```
]
.one-half[
**Less Readable**
```r
# import data
sumA <- read.csv("sample1.csv",
                      header=TRUE,
                      sep=",")

sumB <- read.csv("sample2.csv",
                    header=TRUE,
                    sep=",")
sum <- sumA + sumB

```

## 1. Organization Pro-Tip

> A variable name that describes an object is more useful than a random variable name.

---

## 1. Organization - Benefits

* Your future self will be able to quickly find files.
* Colleagues will be able to more quickly understand your workflow.
* Machine readable names can be quickly and easily sorted and parsed.

---

## 2. Documentation

Document all workflow steps:

* You can remind your future self of your workflow.
* Others can see and understand your work.
* Future "re-analysis" of your data is more efficient.

---

## 2. Documentation - Code

Code should be easy to understand with clear goals:

---

## 2. Documentation - Code

> Document your code even if you think it's clear and simple. Your collaborators
> & your future self will inevitably have an easier time working with it down the road.

---

## Documentation Pro-Tip 1

> Add comments around functions that describe purpose, inputs and outputs.

---

## Documentation Pro-Tip 2
>  Avoid proprietary formats: Use text files (.txt, .md) that don't require special tools to open.

---

## Documentation Pro-Tip 3
>  Markdown to style documentation = machine readable, small file size, low overhead.

---

## Documentation Pro-Tip 4

> Use coding approaches that connect data cleaning, analysis & results

Example Tools: R Markdown and IPython / Jupyter notebooks allow you to publish code and results
in one (or more) output files.
---

## 3. Automation

Automate your workflows when possible by:

* Using scripts vs. point & click approaches.
* Using function-based coding vs. continuous code where tasks are repeated.
* Developing scripted workflows rather than series of tasks (e.g. makefiles).

---

## 3. Automation Benefits - Save Time

* More efficient to modify and repeat an analysis down the road.
* Easier for reviewers and colleagues to see even aspect of your methods.
* Self documenting methods - your future self will likely forget small steps.

---

## 3. Automation Pro-Tip

>  A script may mean more time spent up front, but will save time in the long run.

---
class: inverse, center, middle

## DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself

---
## 3. Automation - DRY

> If your analysis is composed of scripts, with repeated code throughout, it will be more time consuming to maintain and update.

---
class: center, middle

## Automation - Create Modular Code

Modularity -- use functions to write code in reusable chunks.

---
class: center, middle

![Functionalize All Things graphic ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/slide-shows/intro-rr/func-all-things.jpg)


---

## Automation - Functionalize

* Variables created within a function are temporary.
* Code with functions is easier to read / cleaner.
* Supports better documentation.
* Supports testing.
* Allows for code re-use with other data.

---

## 4. Dissemination

> Publishing is not the end of your analysis, rather it is a way towards
> your future research and the future research of others.

---
## 4. Dissemination - Why

* Funding agency / journal requirement.
* Community expects it.
* Increased visibility / citation.
* More efficient, less redundant science.

---

## 4. Dissemination workflow

Example Workflow / Tools:

* Document workflow: **R Markdown / Jupyter Notebooks**
* Collaborate with Colleagues / Version Control : **GitHub**
* Publish Data Snapshot: **FigShare, Dryad, etc**
* Share workflow: ** RPubs , IPython Notebook Viewer**

---
## Facets of Reproducibility: Tools / Skills

1. Documentation: RMarkdown / Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub
2. Organization:  File naming / organization.
3. Automation: Code documentation, Efficient Coding
4. Dissemination: GitHub, Rpubs, ...
